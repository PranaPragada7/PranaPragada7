## Sai Pranav Pragada

Hello, I am a Master’s CS student at Purdue University Northwest (Hammond, IN). Interested in applied AI/ML, computer vision, robotics, and building practical systems.

Currently working on: small end-to-end projects (data → model → usable app), especially retrieval-based assistants and ML workflows.

Tools I use: ML frameworks, semantic search / embeddings, REST APIs, relational databases, containers, CI/CD, and dashboards.
